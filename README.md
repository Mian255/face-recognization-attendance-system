# face-recognization-attendance-system
A Python GUI integrated attendance system using face recognition to take attendance.
In this Python project, I have made an attendance system that takes attendance by using the face recognition technique. I have also integrated it with GUI (Graphical user interface) so it can be easy to use by anyone. GUI for this project is also made in Python using Tkinter.
 tkinter for the whole GUI
 OpenCV for taking images and face recognition (cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create())
 CSV, Numpy, Pandas, datetime, etc. for other purposes.
